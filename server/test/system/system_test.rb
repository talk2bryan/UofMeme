		# The file selection box is a system modal, which basically freezes everything until a file is selected. 
		# Because of this (and for security reasons) drivers handle attaching files to file inputs differently than 
		# most fields. It isn't done by sending keystrokes to fields on the page, but rather by shortcutting the 
		# file modal from appearing and adding the file behind the scenes. Because of that you really can't write a 
		# test that detects the presence of the choose file window.
